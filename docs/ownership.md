# Ownership until v1.0.0

| | |
|---|---|
| Owner | Claude, acting for epistemer (delegated on 2026-11-14) |
| Until | `v1.0.0` is tagged |
| Coding assistant | agy → Gemini. Claude picks the model for each task and never waits for a quota: when a model is cooling down, the strongest available one runs instead |
| Source of truth | [ADR 0001](adr/0001-models-on-sqlc.md) (the design), `interface.md` (the contract, from M1.5), [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) (order and done-when) |
| Record | [status.md](status.md), plus a PR for every code change |

The terms are cfgx's, i18n's and genx's.

## What Claude does without asking

- Plans and sequences the roadmap, and splits items between Claude and agy.
  Moves from one milestone to the next without asking.
- Writes code, tests and docs. Delegates leaf items to agy, each in its own git
  worktree outside the repository.
- Has every change reviewed by the other model family: Gemini reviews Claude's
  work, and Claude reviews Gemini's. Reviews run in a scratch folder that holds
  only what's under review.
- Opens PRs, and merges them into `main` once CI is green and the review
  findings are handled. Docs-only bookkeeping (status log, roadmap ticks) may go
  straight to `main`.
- Decides implementation questions and spike outcomes, each recorded as an ADR.
- Makes amendments that clarify the interface without changing its intent.
  Each is listed in interface.md's amendments and in the status log, so you
  can overturn it.
- Adds dependencies an ADR justifies.
- Tags releases from `v0.1.0` up to, but not including, `v1.0.0`, once a
  release's done-when is met. Release candidates (`v0.1.0-rc.N`) too.
- Manages agy: which tasks Gemini takes, which model and effort each gets, and
  when to review or redo its work.
- Once the interface is frozen, writes and keeps current a global Claude Code
  skill (`~/.claude/skills/models/`), as for cfgx, i18n and genx.

## What comes back to you

1. **API design decisions.** Anything that changes what an app writes or
   gets back, beyond a clarification: the generators' names and parameters,
   the files they write, the Go they generate (types, methods, variable
   names), the keys and paths of labels, and any change to ADR 0001's
   decisions. Claude brings a recommendation. **The freeze of
   `interface.md` (M1.5) is yours.**
2. **Anything Claude lacks permission for.** Work outside this repository
   that isn't on the roadmap. The roadmap's items in genx (M1.3, M1.4) go
   through genx's own terms, which are also Claude's: its interface is
   frozen, so an amendment that changes what an app or a package author
   writes comes back to you. Your accounts, GitHub settings, tokens and paid
   services, speaking for you to other people, and operations the safety
   checks block, such as deleting branches or rewriting history.

## How you follow along

- [status.md](status.md) gets a dated entry for every working session: what
  landed, decisions taken for you, what's next, and what's waiting on you.
- Every code change lands as a PR on GitHub, with its review notes and CI.
- Roadmap boxes are ticked as items meet their done-when.

## How work continues

Claude doesn't run in the background. Work happens while a session runs: when
you say "continue", or on a schedule if you set one up. Each session starts
from the roadmap, the status log and the memory notes, so any session can pick
up where the last one stopped.

## Limits

- **v1.0.0 is your call.** Tagging it promises that keys, generated names and
  parameters won't break, so Claude doesn't tag it on its own.
- **zp stays read-only and private.** Comparisons with zp run on a copy in a
  scratch folder, and nothing of its schema, table names or enum names enters
  this repository. Counts and shapes are fine.
- **Quotas.** agy uses your Gemini quota, and Claude's sessions have context
  limits. Batches of delegations check `agy_status` first.
- **Safety checks still apply.** Claude leaves blocked git operations to you
  rather than working around them.
